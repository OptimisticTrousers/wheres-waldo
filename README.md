> Or clone repo, cd into repo, then run "npm run start"

## Purpose

Creating a 2 application with react-router-dom, using Testing Library and Jest to test, and learning how to use Firebase as a BaaS

Beyond that, other learning outcomes were:

- Design reusable components
- Creating and deleting data inside of a Firebase Firestore database
- Grabbing user coordinates using the cursor
- Using Styled Components to style UI


## Features

1. Allows users to click on an image and select characters from a dropdown menu for their answer
2. Mobile-friendly
3. Leaderboard to allow users to see the top scores
4. Night mode
5. Responsive
6. Sanitizing user input to prevent users from entering profanity into their names

## Instructions

1. Hover over the area you want to select, then click to show a dropdown menu of all of the possible characters. Click on a different part of the image to select another area. For mobile users, simply tap the areas you want to select, then click on the target box to open the menu
2. Try to find the characters as fast as possible to show up in the top leaderboards!
3. Click the hamburger menu in the top-left to play the 6 different levels!
4. After you finish, write your name and you will appear in the leaderboards!

## Areas for Improvement

1. Making the mouse hover on the image to be more smooth. Currently, the target box will only move if you hover outside of the target box.
2. Adding more comprehensive testing
3. Adding more levels
4. Give the user back their time in seconds with demicals instead of seconds

## Known Bugs

1. Target box does not move when the cursor is inside the target box
